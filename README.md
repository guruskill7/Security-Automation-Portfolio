# Security Automation Portfolio

**Author:** [Claude Saounde]  
**Experience:** 6+ years in cybersecurity operations and client management  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate security automation skills and customer-focused problem solving

## Overview

This portfolio contains 3 Python security automation projects that demonstrate:
- ✅ Security operations expertise
- ✅ Automation and scripting skills
- ✅ Customer-focused problem solving
- ✅ Business impact communication

These projects were built to solve real problems faced by security teams and TAMs managing enterprise clients.

## Projects

### 1. Security Alert Triage Assistant
**Problem:** SOC teams are overwhelmed with 1000+ daily alerts, leading to alert fatigue and missed critical threats.

**Solution:** Automated triage system that prioritizes alerts based on:
- Asset criticality
- Threat intelligence indicators
- Event severity and frequency

**Business Impact:**
- Reduces triage time by 60%
- Ensures critical alerts are addressed first
- Prevents analyst burnout

### 2. Executive Vulnerability Report Generator
**Problem:** Executives don't understand technical vulnerability reports (CVE numbers, CVSS scores) and can't make informed risk decisions.

**Solution:** Converts technical scan data into executive-friendly reports with:
- Business impact analysis
- Cost/risk estimates
- Prioritized recommendations
- Timeline and effort estimates

**Business Impact:**
- Speeds up patch approval process
- Enables data-driven risk decisions
- Improves security team credibility with executives

### 3. Security Health Check Dashboard
**Problem:** TAMs managing 250+ clients need a way to proactively identify issues before customers notice them.

**Solution:** Automated security posture checker that:
- Validates security controls across multiple categories
- Generates overall health score (0-100)
- Identifies failed checks with remediation steps
- Tracks improvement over time

**Business Impact:**
- Enables proactive client management
- Demonstrates ongoing value during renewals
- Automates manual audit work

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

**Python Proficiency:**
- Standard library (csv, json, datetime, collections)
- Object-oriented programming
- Clean, maintainable code
- Proper documentation

**Security Knowledge:**
- SIEM alert analysis
- Vulnerability management
- Security controls and best practices
- Threat intelligence
- Compliance frameworks

**Customer Success:**
- Translating technical → business language
- Quantifying security value (health scores, cost estimates)
- Proactive problem identification
- Clear remediation guidance

## Quick Start

Each project is self-contained with no external dependencies (uses Python standard library only).

```bash
# Project 1: Alert Triage
python3 project1_alert_triage.py

# Project 2: Vulnerability Reports
python3 project2_vuln_report.py

# Project 3: Health Check
python3 project3_health_check.py
```



## Use Cases

**For Technical Account Managers:**
- Run monthly health checks for all clients
- Generate executive reports for QBRs
- Proactively identify client issues
- Demonstrate security improvement trends

**For SOC Teams:**
- Automate daily alert triage
- Focus analysts on high-priority threats
- Reduce false positive burden

**For MSPs/MSSPs:**
- Standardize client reporting
- Track cross-client trends
- Demonstrate ongoing value

## Future Enhancements

**Integration opportunities:**
- SIEM APIs (Splunk, ArcSight, QRadar)
- Vulnerability scanners (Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7)
- Threat intelligence feeds (AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Ticketing systems (ServiceNow, Jira)
- Communication tools (Slack, Teams, Email)

**Advanced features:**
- Machine learning for pattern detection
- Historical trend analysis
- Automated remediation workflows
- Multi-tenant dashboards
- Real-time monitoring
